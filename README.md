# Predicting-House-Prices
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the sale prices of houses using a given dataset that contains various features about the homes. This is a classic regression problem, where the aim is to predict a continuous variable (house price) based on several independent variables (house attributes like size, location, etc.).

Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for real estate companies, homeowners, and buyers as it helps make data-driven decisions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project seeks to create a robust model that can generalize well and provide reliable price predictions based on house characteristics.

Workflow
1. Data Collection and Understanding
Use a dataset that contains detailed information about various house features, such as:
Size of the house (square footage)
Number of bedrooms, bathrooms
Location
Year built
Garage space
Lot size
And more
A popular dataset for this type of task is the Ames Housing Dataset available on Kaggle, which you can use or any other similar dataset. The dataset typically includes both categorical and numerical features that impact house prices.

2. Data Preprocessing
Handle Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing data points in the dataset by either filling in appropriate values (mean/median for numerical, mode for categorical) or removing rows with too many missing values.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features (like location, house style, etc.) into numerical representations using techniques such as:
One-hot encoding
Label encoding
Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure that all features are on the same scale. This is important for models like Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting.
Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers that may distort the model's predictions. This could be done via visualization techniques or statistical methods.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Analysis: Use correlation matrices or heatmaps to understand the relationship between various features and the target variable (house price).
Visualization: Create histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to observe the distribution of house prices and how other features relate to the target variable. Visualize key features like the impact of house size, location, and number of rooms on house prices.
Feature Importance: Identify which features are most important for predicting house prices using statistical measures or model-based feature importance techniques.
4. Feature Selection
Select the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the house price prediction. Eliminate any features that have low correlation with the target or exhibit multicollinearity with other features.
5. Model Selection
Test several regression algorithms to find the most suitable model for the prediction task. Possible models include:
Linear Regression: A basic model that establishes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
Decision Tree Regressor: A tree-based algorithm that can model complex, non-linear relationships.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to reduce overfitting.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: Another ensemble method that focuses on improving model performance iteratively.
XGBoost: A high-performance boosting algorithm often used for regression problems with high accuracy.
6. Model Training
Train the chosen model(s) on the preprocessed data. Use the training dataset to fit the model, ensuring the model learns the relationship between features and house prices.
Use cross-validation techniques such as K-Fold Cross-Validation to ensure the model generalizes well and avoids overfitting.
7. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using various performance metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Captures the squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of MSE, giving more weight to large errors.
R-squared (R²): Measures how well the model captures the variability in the house prices. A higher R² indicates a better fit.
Visualize the predicted vs. actual prices using scatter plots to see how well the model is performing.

8. Model Optimization
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters (using GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, etc.) to improve performance.
Regularization: Apply techniques such as Lasso or Ridge regression to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
9. Deployment (Optional)
Deploy the trained model as a web application or API where users can input house features and get a predicted price. You can use frameworks like Flask or Django to create a web interface.
You can also deploy the model on cloud platforms such as AWS or Google Cloud for real-time predictions.
